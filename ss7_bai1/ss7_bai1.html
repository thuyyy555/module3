                <p>Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess, but she would have to be a real
                    princess. He traveled all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There
                    were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones. There was
                    always something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he
                    would have liked very much to have a real princess.

                    One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in
                    torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.</p>
